Chapter 4
Exercise 3: Formatted Printing

   Keep that Makefile around since it'll help you spot errors and we'll be
   adding to it when we need to automate more things.

   Many programming languages use the C way of formatting output, so let's
   try it:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Source 12: ex3.c
   1  #include <stdio.h>
   2
   3  int main()
   4  {
   5      int age = 10;
   6      int height = 72;
   7
   8      printf("I am %d years old.\n", age);
   9      printf("I am %d inches tall.\n", height);
   10
   11      return 0;
   12  }
     __________________________________________________________________

   Once you have that, do the usual make ex3 to build it and run it. Make
   sure you fix all warnings.

   This exercise has a whole lot going on in a small amount of code so
   let's break it down:
    1. First you're including another "header file" called stdio.h. This
       tells the compiler that you're going to use the "standard
       Input/Output functions". One of those is printf.
    2. Then you're using a variable named age and setting it to 10.
    3. Next you're using a variable height and setting it to 72.
    4. Then you use the printf function to print the age and height of the
       tallest 10 year old on the planet.
    5. In the printf you'll notice you're passing in a string, and it's a
       format string like in many other languages.
    6. After this format string, you put the variables that should be
       "replaced" into the format string by printf.

   The result of doing this is you are handing printf some variables and
   it is constructing a new string then printing that new string to the
   terminal.

4.1 What You Should See

   When you do the whole build you should see something like this:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Source 13: Building and running ex3.c
   1$ make ex3
   2cc -Wall -g    ex3.c   -o ex3
   3$ ./ex3
   4I am 10 years old.
   5I am 72 inches tall.
   6$
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pretty soon I'm going to stop telling you to run make and what the
   build looks like, so please make sure you're getting this right and
   that it's working.

4.2 External Research

   In the Extra Credit section of each exercise I may have you go find
   information on your own and figure things out. This is an important
   part of being a self-sufficient programmer. If you constantly run to
   ask someone a question before trying to figure it out first then you
   never learn to solve problems independently. This leads to you never
   building confidence in your skills and always needing someone else
   around to do your work.

   The way you break this habit is to force yourself to try to answer your
   own questions first, and to confirm that your answer is right. You do
   this by trying to break things, experimenting with your possible
   answer, and doing your own research.

   For this exercise I want you to go online and find out all of the
   printf escape codes and format sequences. Escape codes are \n or \t
   that let you print a newline or tab (respectively). Format sequences
   are the %s or %d that let you print a string or a integer. Find all of
   the ones available, how you can modify them, and what kind of
   "precisions" and widths you can do.

   From now on, these kinds of tasks will be in the Extra Credit and you
   should do them.

4.3 How To Break It

   Try a few of these ways to break this program, which may or may not
   cause it to crash on your computer:

    1. Take the age variable out of the first printf call then recompile.
       You should get a couple of warnings.
    2. Run this new program and it will either crash, or print out a
       really crazy age.
    3. Put the printf back the way it was, and then don't set age to an
       initial value by changing that line to int age; then rebuild and
       run again.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Source 14: Breaking ex3.c
   1# edit ex3.c to break printf
   2$ make ex3
   3cc -Wall -g    ex3.c   -o ex3
   4ex3.c: In function 'main':
   5ex3.c:8: warning: too few arguments for format
   6ex3.c:5: warning: unused variable 'age'
   7$ ./ex3
   8I am -919092456 years old.
   9I am 72 inches tall.
   10# edit ex3.c again to fix printf, but don't init age
   11$ make ex3
   12cc -Wall -g    ex3.c   -o ex3
   13ex3.c: In function 'main':
   14ex3.c:8: warning: 'age' is used uninitialized in this function
   15$ ./ex3
   16I am 0 years old.
   17I am 72 inches tall.
   18$
     __________________________________________________________________

4.4 Extra Credit

    1. Find as many other ways to break ex3.c as you can.
    2. Run man 3 printf and read about the other '%' format characters you
       can use. These should look familiar if you used them in other
       languages (printf is where they come from).
    3. Add ex3 to your Makefile's all list. Use this to make clean all and
       build all your exercises so far.
    4. Add ex3 to your Makefile's clean list as well. Now use make clean
       will remove it when you need to.
