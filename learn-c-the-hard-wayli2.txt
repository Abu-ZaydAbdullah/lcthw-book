Preface

   This is a rough in-progress dump of the book. The grammar will probably
   be bad, there will be sections missing, but you get to watch me write
   the book and see how I do things.

   There is a mailing list for the book at lcthw@librelist.com which you
   can join. I'll be doing announcements as new material is up, and you
   can ask questions if you get stuck or have comments.

   This list is a discussion list, not an an announce-only list. It's for
   discussing the book and asking questions.

   Finally, don't forget that I have Learn Python The Hard Way, 2nd
   Edition which you should read if you can't code yet. LCTHW will not be
   for beginners, but for people who have at least read LPTHW or know one
   other programming language.
